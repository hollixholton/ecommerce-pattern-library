decorative-banner: |
  The decorative banner is used on every page except the checkout and the product details pages. It is used to convey important information in a way that is engaging and jumps out at viewers. It features a title, body text and a button that can be linked to other pages. Only dark photography should be used for this banner since the text is white and needs to be visible.

image-text: |
  Image text can be used when you need to pair information and an image. It is designed to be used in a grid system. It could be used to display band photos and descriptions. This is not a replacement for a product card.

intro-text: |
  Intro text is mainly used on the home page but can be implemented elsewhere if needed. It is a sectioned off block of text that can be used for About sections, or for any text information that does not fit into a grid system. This cannot be used on the checkout page but can be used basically anywhere else that it is needed. This section CAN be used in a grid system if needed, but usually it should span across the page with a width of 1 (gridifier).
