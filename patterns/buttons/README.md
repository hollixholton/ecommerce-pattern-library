The buttons use our primary colors to keep in line with the brand. Each button has a specific purpose:

- The regular button is used on forms and cards, and in places with light colored backgrounds
- The light buttons are for areas with dark backgrounds
- The ghost buttons should be used only on banners where the background is an image

You can use different font size classes to change the size of the buttons if you wish.
